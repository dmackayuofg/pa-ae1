# A: Complexity Analysis
Present the following complexity analysis in this report:

+ Big-O complexity of the indexing operation.
+ Big-O complexity of a search operation (given that indexing has been done already).
+ Big-O complexity of a search operation if it were implemented in a brute force fashion (that is, no indexing performed, all search queries go through the entire text of all files every time).

You should be very clear about what you mean by n when presenting your Big-O complexity analysis.

_Note_: You don’t have to do a line-by-line code-analysis like we do in certain other problems. Instead, present your analysis as a text description that walks through the relevant operations, comments on their complexity with rationale, and then presents the overall complexity.
